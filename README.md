This is a firmware for keyboards based on the ESP32.

It is heavily based on [Galzai's MK32](https://github.com/Galzai/MK32) which is much more mature so you probably want to check his before trying to use this one. I started doing this as an ESP-IDF learning exercise and therefore the project is subject of being abandoned at any time.

## Hardware
I'm using a modified [chimera ls board](https://github.com/GlenPickle/Chimera) with the ground lines cut into columns and soldered to the free connectors [along with this board](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=3bc6005ff632444b8dbe011c222f33c0|7e9e5cd462c54c739974ab717fe0ccea). This is whoever a temporal setup and I plan to create a custom PCB.
